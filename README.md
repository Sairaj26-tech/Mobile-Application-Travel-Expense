# Mobile-Application-Travel-Expense
Description:
M Expense is a smartphone app that helps you keep track of your business expenses. Excursions, 
food, and housing may all be part of the package. The main purpose of this app is to aid customers in 
calculating the amount of money they spent on their outing. Customers can customise the application 
by adding charges. The application records and saves all data on the server. You can explore specific 
excursions, transfer excursions, and keep track of the stats that the server has transferred up to that 
point with the software.
